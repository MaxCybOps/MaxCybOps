## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a multidisciplinary technology professional with over 5 years of experience across cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, software engineering, and blockchain development. Based in Lagos, Nigeria, I hold a B.Eng in Mechatronics Engineering from the Federal University of Technology, Owerri (FUTO) — a foundation that gave me a systems-level understanding of how hardware, software, and networks interact, and how they fail.

Over the course of my career I have worked across both offensive and defensive security — conducting penetration tests, building SOC environments, simulating advanced persistent threats, and delivering professional VAPT reports to real organizations. I have also built full-stack applications, trained machine learning models for security use cases, and integrated blockchain technology into production-ready platforms. This breadth is not accidental — I believe that the most effective security professionals are those who understand how systems are built, because that is the only way to truly understand how they are broken.

What drives me professionally is the challenge of solving problems that sit at the boundary of disciplines. My AI-driven malware classifier, for instance, was born from the question — what if we could detect threats that signature databases have never seen before? That kind of thinking, applied consistently, is what I bring to every project I work on.

I am currently open to remote opportunities in cybersecurity, AI/ML engineering, full-stack development, and blockchain engineering. I work with precision, document everything professionally, and communicate clearly with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## 🔧 What I Do

**🔐 Cybersecurity & Penetration Testing**
I conduct full-lifecycle penetration testing across web, API, mobile, IoT, and SCADA environments — from reconnaissance and exploitation through to privilege escalation, lateral movement, and post-exploitation analysis. Every engagement is documented with professional VAPT reports aligned to ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, MITRE ATT&CK, and PCI-DSS frameworks, with clear CVSS scoring and actionable remediation guidance. On the defensive side, I build and operate SOC environments using Splunk, Wazuh, and ELK Stack, design detection rules and dashboards, and develop incident response playbooks tailored to real-world threat scenarios including nation-state APT campaigns.

**🤖 AI & Machine Learning**
I apply machine learning to real-world security and engineering problems. My AI-driven malware classifier uses static analysis of Portable Executable files to detect malicious software without relying on signature databases — achieving 78% accuracy using a Random Forest pipeline trained on 1,000 samples. I am formally trained in supervised and unsupervised learning, CNNs, sequence models, reinforcement learning, transformers, generative AI, and large language models through Oracle Cloud Infrastructure AI Foundations, with 80–100% scores across all assessments.

**💻 Full-Stack Software Development**
I build clean, functional, well-documented applications using JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Python, and Golang. My development philosophy is security-first — every application I build incorporates access controls, input validation, and threat modeling from day one. My recent full-stack project, Aletheia, demonstrates this approach: a complete property management platform with a Go backend, Supabase database, Paystack payment integration, and real-time SMS and email notifications.

**⛓️ Blockchain & Web3 Engineering**
I design and build blockchain-integrated systems that are powerful under the hood but invisible to end users. Aletheia anchors every rent payment to the 0G Chain and stores lease agreements on decentralized storage — without requiring any crypto knowledge from landlords or tenants. I also bring smart contract security awareness to every Web3 engagement, with training in Solidity, DeFi, DAOs, NFTs, and account abstraction through Cyfrin Updraft.
